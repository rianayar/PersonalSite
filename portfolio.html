        <h3>Hope for the Homeless</h3>
        <p>
          Check out the<a

            >website</a
          >we made as part of our 8th grade IB project to raise awareness of the
          homelessness situation in Tampa, Florida. Our group was able to learn
          more about the homeless population with extensive research and become
          aware of the impact local charities and nonprofits have on them.

        <h3>FIRST Like A Girl</h3>
        <p>
          I coordinated the creation of a set of interview videos for our FIRST
          Robotics Team to support the #FIRSTLikeAGirl movement that are
          uploaded to<a class = "ahref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUmu5P_QoPs">YouTube</a>.This 
          movement supports gender equality in a STEM robotics club. We
          also made buttons and boards, and helped spread word through social
          media posts on our Team's<a href="https://www.instagram.com/frc1369/"
            >Instagram</a

      <!-- Third Project -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Homeless Supply Drive</h3>
        <p>
          I spent a week<a class = "ahref" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/homeless-supply-donations">fundraising</a>to deliver non-perishable groceries, fresh produce, and sanitary
          products for homeless shelters across Tampa. These items were used in
          soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and homeless resident programs. I
          coordinated with Homeless Helping Homeless, Metropolitan Ministries,
          and Salvation Army of Tampa to figure out what products they need and
          the quantity of each. I was able to help provide for some homeless
          people during the Covid-19 pandemic.

        <h3>Virtual Volunteering with Assisted Living Facilities</h3>
        <p>
          A group of friends and I have been setting up weekly zoom meetings
          with the residents of local Tampa senior homes in order to perform
          piano pieces for them and engage in conversations with them. This
          project started during the Covid-19 pandemic and will hopefully
          continue on past it.
